# 3d Game demo with the Williams Game Engine

This repository is a transformation of the Williams Game engine from a simple 2d based game engine to one which has 3d graphics, this is done with multiple matrices the main one matproj is used to change the vectors of 3 points to 2d coordinates, the project can still be heavily optimized and that's probably what I'll do with it in the future.

## Additional details

All isometric sprites that this program uses are available in the Resources folder. However I am not the greatest pixel artist nor do I claim to be,
so the sense of isometric 3d this game is capable of producting is only as limited as the sprites allow.
My fork of the Williams Game Engine shows the tutorial at the end point of a fully polished game, this is a kind of continuation of it to figure out what's truly possible.
It is entirely possible that I could transform the Game Engine into one that can fully support 3d but that is probably far off in the future.
Changes will most likely not be made to this repo, after June 20th of 2023. However it is still a great benchmark to compare my future repos to.
