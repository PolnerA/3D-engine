# 3D Game demo with the Williams Game Engine

This repository is a transformation of the Williams Game engine from a simple 2d based game engine to one which has 3d graphics, 
this is done with multiple matrices the main one matproj is used to change the vectors of 3 points to 2d coordinates, 
it can be used to create functional 3d graphics using SFML and the majority of the code left from the Williams Game Engine.

## Additional details

You can change the shape that's desplayed by adding new triangles for a different mesh that's not a cube, 
for example you can make a rectangle or a pyramid, This is just a simple demonstration of 3d graphics and how they work.

## Credits

SFML-based game engine was originally written in C++ by Eric Williams. Ported to C# by [Mike Magruder](https://github.com/mikemag). 
Code for the 3d Demo was mostly from [this 3d engine demo](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/Javidx9/blob/master/ConsoleGameEngine/BiggerProjects/Engine3D/OneLoneCoder_olcEngine3D_Part1.cpp)
This repo is almost the same ported from C++ to C#.
