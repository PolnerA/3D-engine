# Isometric Game with the Williams Game Engine

This repo is a simple game, or rather a demonstration of isometric design within a 2d game engine (Williams game engine) Made by Adam Polner in Michael T. Miyoshi's intro to programming class.
some changes have been made to the game engine, most notably the different lists to render things first or last. 
Everything is commented and changes in the game engine are commented with -AP.

## Additional details

All isometric sprites that this program uses are available in the Resources folder. However I am not the greatest pixel artist nor do I claim to be,
so the sense of isometric 3d this game is capable of producting is only as limited as the sprites allow.
My fork of the Williams Game Engine shows the tutorial at the end point of a fully polished game, this is a kind of continuation of it to figure out what's truly possible.
It is entirely possible that I could transform the Game Engine into one that can fully support 3d but that is probably far off in the future.
Changes will most likely not be made to this repo, after June 20th of 2023. However it is still a great benchmark to compare my future repos to.
